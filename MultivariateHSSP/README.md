Implementations of paper [A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Solving the Hidden Subset Sum Problem](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/461.pdf).

- [A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Solving the Hidden Subset Sum Problem.ipynb](./MultivariateHSSP/A%20Polynomial-Time%20Algorithm%20for%20Solving%20the%20Hidden%20Subset%20Sum%20Problem.ipynb) : A step by step implementation of both Nguyen-Stern attack and multivariate attack with details.
- [ns_attack.sage](./MultivariateHSSP/ns_attack.sage) : Nguyen-Stern attack.
- [multivariate_attack.sage](./MultivariateHSSP/multivariate_attack.sage) : multivariate attack.
- [paper_implementation.sage](./MultivariateHSSP/paper_implementation.sage) : paper implementation with `flatter` (faster version, 8 Ã— times faster when $n = 190$.).
