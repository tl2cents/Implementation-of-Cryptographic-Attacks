    "The attack from the papper is able to make use of five components of the RSA private key: $p, q, d, d_p$, and $d_q$. We can use known bits in $d, d_p$, and $d_q$ to make progress where bits in $p$ and $q$ are not known. To relate $d$ to the rest of the private key, we make use of techniques due to Boneh, Durfee, and Frankel; to relate $d_p$ and $d_q$ to the rest of the private key, we make new observations about the structure of RSA keys that may be of independent interest.\n",

    "What is more, we can easily see that, having fixed bits $<i$ of $p$, a change in $p[i]$ affects $d_p$ not in bit $i$ but in bit $i+\\tau\\left(k_p\\right)$; and, similarly, a change in $q[i]$ affects $d_q\\left[i+\\tau\\left(k_q\\right)\\right]$, and a change in $p[i]$ or $q[i]$ affects $d[i+\\tau(k)]$. When any of $k, k_p$, or $k_q$ is odd, this is just the trivial statement that changing bit $i$ of the right-hand side of an equation changes bit $i$ of the left-hand side. Powers of 2 in $k_p$ shift left the bit affected by $p[i]$, and similarly for the other variables.\n",

Above, we already described how to obtain the only possible solution up to $i=0$; this is the solution we use to start the algorithm.
